# Playwright Execution Protocol

When a task involves:
- UI behavior validation
- E2E testing
- Browser flows
- Regression validation
- Visual or interaction issues

You must:

1. Generate or update Playwright tests.
2. Execute Playwright MCP.
3. Capture output, logs, screenshots if available.
4. Analyze failures.
5. Fix code or tests.
6. Re-run Playwright MCP until passing.

Never assume correctness without execution.
